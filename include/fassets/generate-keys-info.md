!!! info

    This command can only be executed once, after which all secret keys will be generated.
    You must use a separate directory for each role you want to perform: agent, bot, or minter and redeemer.

!!! warning

    The addresses in `secrets.json` are designed to be used as hot wallets and should not hold large amounts of tokens, since their private keys are accessible on a machine that is permanently online.
    Instead, it's best to keep your main account in an offline wallet and transfer funds to these hot wallets as needed.
