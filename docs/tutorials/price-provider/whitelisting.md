# Whitelisting

As a price provider, there are two separate whitelisting processes:

* Whitelisting your observation node with the flare team. See more in [setting-up-an-observation-node](../price-provider/setting-up-an-observation-node/README.md#whitelisting)
* Whitelisting your price provider, which is a fully decentralized process detailed in [ftso-price-provider](../price-provider/ftso-price-provider/whitelisting-a-price-provider.md)
