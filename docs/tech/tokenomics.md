# Tokenomics

Flare’s token economics support Flare’s ambition to connect the decentralized economy and drive broader adoption of web3.
These tokenomics help to create a more balanced playing field where multiple connected ecosystems have an incentive to grow and participate with Flare.
The adoption of [FIP.01](https://flare.network/fip01/) on [January 27, 2023](https://portal.flare.network/proposal/view/31313223399225215467886651717691514407244212421129328237186875197531473335173) enabled this approach by changing the mechanism of the public token distribution.

## Token Allocation

At network genesis, 100 Billion `$FLR` tokens (100,000,000,000) were created.
They have been allocated to the following groups.

Note the delegation, claiming, and voting abilities of each, defined here:

* **Can delegate**: The entity can [delegate](./ftso.md#delegation) tokens to the Flare Time Series Oracle to earn standard inflationary rewards.
* **Can claim**: The entity can wrap tokens to claim a portion of the [FlareDrop](./the-flaredrop.md).
* **Can vote**: The entity can use its tokens to participate in [governance](./governance.md) by voting on Flare Improvement Proposals.

## High-Level View

The majority of tokens are destined for community ownership, whether by direct token distribution, network incentives, or through the Flare Foundation ecosystem programs.

## Flare Token Utility

Flare is an EVM-based Layer 1 that gives developers decentralized access to data from other chains and the internet.
This access enables new use cases and monetization models, while allowing apps to serve multiple chains through a single deployment.

`$FLR` is the network token and provides support for each of these functions:

* Incentivized [delegation](./ftso.md#delegation) to the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) to support the provision of reliable decentralized data.
* Collateral within decentralized applications built on Flare blockchains (cross-chain or solely native).
* Participation within network [governance](./governance.md).
* Transaction fees to prevent spam attacks.

## Public Distribution

Here are important highlights of the public token distribution, updated following approval of Flare Improvement Proposal 01 (FIP.01).
The full details are available in the [FIP.01 blog post](https://flare.network/fip01/).

The 28,524,921,372 `$FLR` public distribution is split into two parts:

* The first 15%, the initial Airdrop, which equates to 4,278,738,206 `$FLR`, was distributed during the Token Distribution Event (TDE) on January 9, 2023 to wallets that held XRP on December 12, 2020.
* The remaining 85% or 24,246,183,166 `$FLR`, the [FlareDrop](./the-flaredrop.md), are being distributed over 36 monthly amounts directly to token holders who have wrapped their `$FLR` into `$WFLR`. There will be 35 monthly distributions of 2.37% of the total (676,040,637 `$FLR`) and a final distribution of the remaining 2.05% of the total (584,760,871 `$FLR`) in month 36.

## Inflation Calculation

Annual inflation is calculated based on circulating supply and changes as the first 3 years progress:

* 10% in year 1.
* 7% in year 2.
* 5% from year 3 onwards.

## Vesting Detail

Vesting occurs when the full rights to an asset are gradually acquired over a pre-determined schedule.
One cannot exercise any of the rights to each portion of the asset until its agreed-upon vesting date, thus incentivizing participation and strengthening the community.
Additionally, the future right to an asset cannot be taken away unless stipulated in the vesting agreement, such as the requirement for employee status on a vesting date.

Flare tokens are subject to vesting schedules as follows.

<table markdown>

<tr><td>Flare Networks Limited (FNL)</td><td>12.5 billion</td><td rowspan="3">Subject to 36-month vesting schedule, with 15% on token distribution event (TDE) and the remainder vesting in 35 monthly amounts of 2.37% of the total and one final amount of 2.05% of the total in month 36.</td></tr>

<br>
No tokens permitted to be sold within the first 6 months. A maximum of 10% of vested tokens permitted to be sold within months 7-12. A maximum of 25% of total vested tokens (including any already sold) permitted to be sold within months 13-18.</td></tr>

## Supply Metrics

The first three charts show month 0 `$FLR` data and the remaining charts show `$FLR` trends over 36 months and at 36 months. The charts visualize aspects of these metrics:

* **Total Supply:** Initial supply at genesis + inflation.
* **Initial Supply:** Unlocked distributed tokens + all locked tokens. 100B `$FLR` created at genesis.
* **Circulating Supply:** Unlocked distributed tokens. Tokens provided through the initial token distribution event, FTSO delegation rewards, and FlareDrops and vesting schedules.
* **Liquid Supply:** Sellable. Circulating Supply at liberty to be sold.

</figure>

Example: The Flare team can't sell their tokens immediately, but they can use them to earn FTSO rewards. Their tokens are circulating, but not liquid.

### Month 0 $FLR

#### Circulating $FLR

The recipients of the initial token distribution (Airdrop) are the largest single group of token holders.
These tokens are available for network participation.

Please note that the Flare Foundation and Flare Networks Limited amounts also include the unlocked backers’ tokens because this is before their distribution commences in month 6.

<figure markdown>
![Month 0 Circulating $FLR](tokenomics-month-0-circulating-flr.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom width=500px }
<figcaption markdown>Month 0: Circulating `$FLR` token distribution (12.0B `$FLR`).</figcaption markdown>
</figure>

#### Liquid $FLR

Although Flare team members can use their initial token distribution to participate fully in the network and support reliable FTSO data provision, they are restricted from selling any of the tokens they receive in the first 6 months, and no more than 25% within the first 18 months.

As per the [Circulating `$FLR`](#circulating-flr) chart, the FF & FNL percentages include the unlocked but as yet undistributed backers’ tokens.

<figcaption markdown>Month 0: Liquid `$FLR` token distribution (10.0B `$FLR`).</figcaption markdown>
</figure>

#### Total $FLR

80.2% of the initial total distribution (100B at genesis) is permitted to vote in governance, leaving 19.8% that is not permitted to vote (Flare Foundation & Flare VC Fund).

### 36-Month $FLR

#### Circulating and Liquid $FLR

Once the 36-month token distribution is complete, there will be 93.9B `$FLR` liquid and circulating.

<figure markdown>

<figcaption markdown>Month 36: Circulating and liquid `$FLR` token distribution (93.9B `$FLR`).</figcaption markdown>
</figure>

#### Distribution Schedule

After the initial 15% distribution, the majority of entities receive the remainder of their allocation smoothly over 36 months.
The tokens are available for network participation, including governance and delegation to FTSO, but they are not liquid.

<figure markdown>
![36 Month Token Distribution Schedule for Network Participation](tokenomics-36-month-token-distribution-schedule-network-participation.png){ loading=lazy .allow-zoom width=500px }
<figcaption markdown>36-month `$FLR` token distribution schedule.</figcaption markdown>
</figure>

The slight bumps are due to the delayed distribution of backer tokens commencing in months 6 and 13.

#### Liquid Supply

Due to the restrictions placed on team token sales described in the [Liquid `$FLR`](#liquid-flr) chart above, until month 19 there are fewer liquid tokens than there are tokens able to participate in governance and delegate to the FTSO.

<figcaption markdown>36-month `$FLR` liquid token distribution schedule.</figcaption markdown>
</figure>

#### Circulating Supply

After 36 months, 85% of `$FLR` will be circulating (93.9B of a total 110.1B `$FLR`).

#### Vote Power

Vote Power is the weight applied to a community member's vote, proportional to the amount of wrapped Flare or Songbird tokens (`$WFLR` or `$WSGB`) it holds, plus any amount delegated to it.
From day 1, the Token Distribution Event (TDE), Flare has had below 50% governance vote power, with this percentage decreasing further throughout the distribution period.
Flare’s vote power is calculated from the sum of unlocked tokens held by Flare Networks Limited (FNL) plus the team and advisors.
