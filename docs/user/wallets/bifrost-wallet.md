# Bifrost Wallet

Bifrost Wallet is a **noncustodial mobile wallet** available for both Android and iOS.
You can view your portfolio of crypto assets, access decentralized applications through the in-app browser and perform operations on various blockchain networks, including sending, receiving, wrapping and delegating Flare (`$FLR`) and Songbird (`$SGB`).

## Getting Started

Start by downloading Bifrost Wallet from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bifrost-wallet/id1577198351) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bifrostwallet.app) and either create a new wallet or import an existing one from a recovery phrase.

The official guides in the [Bifrost Wallet help center](https://support.bifrostwallet.com) may be of assistance.

!!! note "Please make sure you have installed at least version 0.4.5"

!!! note "XRP Airdrop"

    Note that, **once `$FLR` distribution begins**, users who imported their Ethereum-style claim address into Bifrost to access the XRP airdrop will automatically see their tokens in the Flare asset row in the `COINS` section.

## Adding Flare Tokens

When your balance of any native or wrapped token on the Flare network or Songbird network is more than 0, Bifrost Wallet automatically displays the balance. No additional action is required.

## Wrap and Delegate

To wrap and delegate your `$FLR` or `$SGB` tokens using Bifrost Wallet, see [the official guide](https://support.bifrostwallet.com/en/articles/5588951-wrap-and-delegate-songbird).
