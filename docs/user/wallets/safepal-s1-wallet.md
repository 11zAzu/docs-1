# SafePal S1 Wallet

SafePal S1 is a **non-custodial hardware wallet** that is considered one of the most secure ways to manage your crypto assets.

## Getting Started

Purchase a SafePal S1 hardware device from the [official SafePal website](https://shop.safepal.io) in the products section and download their mobile app from either the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safepal-wallet/id1548297139) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.safepal.wallet).

Use of a SafePal S1 hardware wallet requires syncing the device with the mobile app.
A step by step unboxing guide to initialize a new device/wallet, or import an existing one from a recovery phrase, can be found here: [https://safepalsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046051752-How-to-Set-Up-a-S1-Hardware-Wallet](https://safepalsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046051752-How-to-Set-Up-a-S1-Hardware-Wallet).

Once your S1 device is set up and synced with the mobile app you will need to add `$SGB` and `$FLR` to your listed assets:

1. Ensure the SafePal S1 is updated with the latest firmware, **version V1.0.32** or later.
2. Login to your SafePal mobile app and have your S1 device turned on and unlocked.
3. Scroll to the bottom of your listed assets in the mobile app and click **Add**.
4. Search for Songbird (`$SGB`) or Flare (`$FLR`) and click the gray button on the right which will then turn blue.
5. Click the **Add Coin** box also in blue at the bottom of the screen.
6. Follow the series of prompts which require scanning QR codes from both your S1 wallet and mobile app to finalize adding the asset.

## Wrap and Delegate

SafePal users can access existing decentralized applications (dapps) created by independent FTSO data providers to wrap and delegate their `$SGB` and`$FLR` tokens:

1. Open the SafePal mobile app and navigate to the built-in web browser by clicking the four squares at the bottom middle of the screen.
2. Enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in the search bar at the top of the screen.

    !!! info

         These dapps are usually created by FTSO [data providers](glossary.md#data_provider), but some of them allow you to choose a different data provider to delegate to.
         Take a look at [flaremetrics.io](https://flaremetrics.io/) and pick the one you prefer.

3. After copying and pasting the address, click the drop-down menu to the right of the search tab.
4. Scroll down, select the **Songbird** or **Flare** networks, and click **Go**.
5. A pop up will appear notifying that you are being redirected to a third party dapp. Press **Confirm**.

Other data providers host similar websites or dapps for wrapping and delegation.
