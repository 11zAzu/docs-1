    Always review all transaction details on your Ledger device before confirming any transaction!

## Wrap and Delegate

Once connected to the Songbird or Flare networks, enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in the MetaMask browser.
A few of the data providers have developed dapps integrated with their websites that allow users to wrap, delegate and claim rewards.
Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific provider, as these dapps allow you to choose from a number of different providers.

Many data providers have developed dapps for wrapping and delegation.
Take a look at [flaremetrics.io](https://flaremetrics.io/) and pick the one you prefer.

Other providers have their own websites and are developing similar dapps.
