# D'CENT Wallet

D'CENT Biometric Wallet is a **non-custodial hardware wallet** and is considered one of the most secure ways to manage your crypto assets.

## Getting Started

Purchase a D'CENT Biometric hardware wallet from the [official D'CENT shop](https://dcentwallet.com/Shop) or download their software wallet/mobile app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dcent-wallet/id1447206611) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kr.iotrust.dcent.wallet).
Then either initialize a new wallet or import an existing one from a recovery phrase.

The official D'cent device setup help guides can be found here: [https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up).

Once your device is set up and synced with the mobile app you will need to add `$FLR` and `$SGB` to your listed assets:
