# Tools and Projects

The following tools and projects already support the Flare network.

## Indexing and Querying

Blockchains typically store the history of all transactions but not the latest, consolidated state of individual accounts.
The companies below provide fast access to this information

* [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/flare/)
* [SubQuery](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/flare.html)

## Monitoring Tools

These tools report information about Flare networks:

* [Flare Builders](https://www.flare.builders/)
* [FlareMetrics](https://flaremetrics.io/)
* [Validators, presented by Towo Labs](https://validators.towolabs.com/)

## Node Providers

[Validator nodes](../tech/validators.md) are online servers running a blockchain's client software.
They ensure that stored data is consistent and provide access to this data for applications.

Applications are encouraged to deploy their own nodes for enhanced reliability.
The companies below offer nodes-as-a-service, greatly simplifying deployment and operational costs.

* [Flare API Portal](https://api-portal.flare.network/)
* [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/documentation/guides/flare/how-to-connect-to-flare/)
* [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/blog/flare-ankr-s-next-blockchain-connection/)

## Storage

Storing large amounts of data on-chain is typically very expensive.
These are some decentralized storage alternatives.

* [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/developers/introduction/filecoin-and-ipfs)
* [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech)
* [Crust Network](https://www.crust.network)
* [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud)
* [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage)
* [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org)

## Wallets

Please see the [Wallet user guides](../user/wallets/index.md) for a list of wallets currently supporting the Flare network.
