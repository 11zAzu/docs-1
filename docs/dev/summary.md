# Flare and the EVM

The Songbird and Flare networks runs the Ethereum EVM, which means that Ethereum contracts and tools can be used to develop on top of these chains.
Both networks are layer 1 networks, and are running independently of main-net Ethereum.

All existing tools and technologies available for Ethereum can be leveraged on Songbird and Flare.
The main infrastructure ([FTSO](glossary.md#ftso), [State Connector](glossary.md#state_connector), ...) is written in Solidity using standard tools: ethers, web3, hardhat.
